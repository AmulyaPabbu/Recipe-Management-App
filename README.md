# Recipe-Management-App

Hello, this is a project which along with other two teammates, I worked on during my Master's. This we did as a mandatory part of the course: Advanced Database Systems. We developed this application where admin and users will be able to register, login/logout, add, edit, delete, view and search for recipes and also manage their profiles. Recipes can be categorized as well. I leveraged this and hence used it for Software testing. Here I personally worked on Requirement analysis, System design, Development, Testing(STLC) phases of SDLC. I used Trello for project management. Thank you.
