# Recipe-Management-App

Hello, this is a project along with teammates, I worked on during my Master's. This we did as a mandatory part of the course: Advanced Database Systems. Being the project leader, I really enjoyed working from initiation to completion. I leveraged this opportunity and hence used it for Software testing. Here I personally worked on Requirement analysis, System design, Development, Testing(STLC) phases of SDLC. I used Trello for project management. Thank you.
